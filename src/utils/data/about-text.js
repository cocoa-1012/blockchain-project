  introduction:
    'Foundation is a platform that aims to build a new creative economy—a world where creators can use the Ethereum blockchain to value their online expression in entirely new ways, and build stronger connections with their supporters.',
  invitation:
    'Foundation bridges crypto and culture to foster a network of mutual support between artists, creators, and collectors. We’re forging a community-driven path and sharing our tools with the rapidly evolving group of developers who are excited to define this future with us. We want anyone and everyone who cares about the future of digital expression to be a part of it.',
  forCreators:
    'Creators are invited to join Foundation by members of the community. Once you’ve received an invite, you’ll need to set up a MetaMask wallet with ETH before you can create an artist profile and mint an NFT—which means uploading your JPG, PNG, or video file to IPFS, a decentralized peer-to-peer storage network. It will then be an NFT you can price in ETH and put up for auction on Foundation. Creators receive 85% of the final sale price. If the piece is resold on Foundation (or OpenSea and Rarible), a 10% royalty goes back to the wallet that originally minted the NFT—in perpetuity.',
  forCollectors:
    'On Foundation, anyone can create a profile to start collecting NFTs. All you’ll need is a MetaMask wallet and ETH, the cryptocurrency used to pay for all transactions on Ethereum. Artists list NFTs for auction at a reserve price, and once the first bid is placed, a 24-hour auction countdown begins. If a bid is placed within the last 15 minutes, the auction extends for another 15 minutes. When you win an auction and claim the NFT, the artwork gets transferred to your wallet and appears on your Foundation collector profile. You can also then display it in your virtual gallery, share it on social media, sell it later on the secondary market, or pioneer a new approach to appreciating digital art and championing the artists in your collection.',
  forDevelopers:
    'We love collaborating, and invite developers to experiment with [our free and open API](https://fnd.dev/docs).',
  forTheCommunity:
    'There are many ways to get involved with Foundation beyond joining as a creator, collector, or developer. We welcome anyone interested in collectively building the future of digital culture to join us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/withfoundation) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/withfnd). There are a number of community-led initiatives and events that you can plug into, participate in, and even imagine new possibilities for. We actively encourage community members to create new groups based around their interests.',
  ourTeam:
    'Our team brings together leading talent from the crypto and creative communities, to the cultural realm. We’ve spent time at Eyebeam, Google, Harvard, Kickstarter, New Museum, Phillips, Princeton, and The Broad. In our spare time, we also design apparel, produce electronic music, paint, make films, and curate museum exhibitions.',

You just have to push through and make it happen… With NFTs, I want to push at what’s possible myself, and I also watch and see what other people are up to. I’ve been brainstorming, and fuck, there are so many things that we could all do. I’m really excited to see how it all continues to take shape, and be a part of it.”',
